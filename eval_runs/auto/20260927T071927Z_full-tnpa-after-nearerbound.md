  - attempt 2: valid
- pricing_type: 'per_unit' params: {'rate': 117.08}
- (material) The rate is stated as 117.08 per 100 tons or part thereof, but the proposal gives a gross-tonnage per_unit rate of 117.08 without representing the 100-ton charging increment. As written, this can charge 117.08 for each ton rather than for each 100-ton block (or part).
- (material) The proposal sets multiplicity=per_call, but the source says light dues are raised at the first South African port of call and remain valid until departure from the last South African port of call, subject to the stated conditions. That is one charge across the qualifying South African port sequence, not a separate charge at every port call.

  - attempt 2: valid
- pricing_type: 'base_plus_increment_times_duration' params: {'basic_rate': 192.73, 'daily_rate': 57.79}
- (material) The proposal treats the 470.98 minimum fee as part of port dues and claims it is a floor retained when the 35% port-dues reduction applies. Page 11 places this minimum in the berth-dues wording: it is stated to be “in addition to port dues” and is charged per 24-hour period or part thereof. It therefore should not be encoded as a port-dues minimum or as a floor on the port-dues reduction.
- (material) The mapped rates omit the printed charging unit: page 11 states both the basic fee and the increment are charged per 100 tons or part thereof, and the increment is per 24-hour period with a part of a period applied pro rata. The proposal gives only gross_tonnage and numeric rates, without preserving the per-100-ton unit (and the pro-rata time condition), which can change the calculated amount.
- (material) The proposal omits the tariff's stated 15% VAT applicability. Page 11 labels the section tariffs as subject to VAT at 15%; unless VAT is applied elsewhere in the extraction, this omission understates the amount charged.

- (material) The proposal omits the Section 3.2 marine-services incentive, which explicitly applies to craft assistance service charges. Eligible cargo-working shipping lines can receive a per-port-call discount based on vessel/cargo type and call threshold, up to the stated maximum number of calls; this changes the towage amount charged.
- (material) The proposal's time-delay modifier incorrectly describes the charge as applying when the vessel arrives or departs 30 minutes or more after the notified time. Section 3.6 instead prints a per-tug, per-half-hour fee in that circumstance, but does not say it is a surcharge or added to the ordinary service fee; it is a separate timed fee. The proposal's formulation can lead to charging the ordinary fee plus this amount without source support.
- (material) The proposal omits the stated craft-allocation limit relevant to which tugs/services attract the listed additional-tug surcharge: the craft type and number allocated for a service are decided by the port, and surcharge applies to a tug provided in addition to the maximum allocation. The amount/application therefore depends on this allocation, which the proposal does not preserve.
- (minor) The proposal says the additional-tug surcharge of 50% applies when the additional tug is provided on the master's request or deemed necessary for safety by the Harbour Master, but the source specifies it is payable per tug and explicitly limits it to provision in addition to the maximum craft allocation. This repeats the omitted allocation qualifier and can affect amount applicability; ensure the qualifier is retained.
- (material) The proposal applies the same +25% after-standby cancellation modifier as if it were a 25% surcharge, but the source says fees as if the service had been performed are payable, i.e. normal fees enhanced by 25%. This is a 125% total charge, rather than a standalone 25% fee; the proposal does not clearly preserve that full-fee-plus-enhancement basis.

- (material) The proposal omits the separate Saldanha charge for pilots on board tanker vessels during the vessel’s stay: the source lists PLO duties at 886.20 per hour. This is an additional pilotage service and is not represented by the normal entering/leaving-port tariff.
- (material) The proposal omits the stated rule that any vessel movement without the Authority’s consent is subject to full pilotage charges as if the service had been performed. This changes when pilotage charges are payable, even where a pilotage service was not actually performed.

- (material) The incremental tariff is stated as “per 100 tons or part thereof,” but the proposal records only a gross-tonnage basis and rate, omitting the 100-ton billing unit. Applying the rate per gross ton instead of per 100 tons (rounded up) would produce a different charge.
- (material) The proposal omits the separate charge for berthing staff attending aboard tanker vessels discharging crude or petroleum products (including LPG vessels) at Mossel Bay and Saldanha Bay: 1,267.83 per hour or part thereof. This is an additional berthing-services tariff for the specified service, not represented by the listed general per-service tariff.

### Disagreements
- **light_dues**: The rate is stated as 117.08 per 100 tons or part thereof, but the proposal gives a gross-tonnage per_unit rate of 117.08 without representing the 100-ton charging increment. As written, this can charge 117.08 for each ton rather than for each 100-ton block (or part).; The proposal sets multiplicity=per_call, but the source says light dues are raised at the first South African port of call and remain valid until departure from the last South African port of call, subject to the stated conditions. That is one charge across the qualifying South African port sequence, not a separate charge at every port call.
- **port_dues**: The proposal treats the 470.98 minimum fee as part of port dues and claims it is a floor retained when the 35% port-dues reduction applies. Page 11 places this minimum in the berth-dues wording: it is stated to be “in addition to port dues” and is charged per 24-hour period or part thereof. It therefore should not be encoded as a port-dues minimum or as a floor on the port-dues reduction.; The mapped rates omit the printed charging unit: page 11 states both the basic fee and the increment are charged per 100 tons or part thereof, and the increment is per 24-hour period with a part of a period applied pro rata. The proposal gives only gross_tonnage and numeric rates, without preserving the per-100-ton unit (and the pro-rata time condition), which can change the calculated amount.; The proposal omits the tariff's stated 15% VAT applicability. Page 11 labels the section tariffs as subject to VAT at 15%; unless VAT is applied elsewhere in the extraction, this omission understates the amount charged.
- **towage**: The proposal omits the Section 3.2 marine-services incentive, which explicitly applies to craft assistance service charges. Eligible cargo-working shipping lines can receive a per-port-call discount based on vessel/cargo type and call threshold, up to the stated maximum number of calls; this changes the towage amount charged.; The proposal's time-delay modifier incorrectly describes the charge as applying when the vessel arrives or departs 30 minutes or more after the notified time. Section 3.6 instead prints a per-tug, per-half-hour fee in that circumstance, but does not say it is a surcharge or added to the ordinary service fee; it is a separate timed fee. The proposal's formulation can lead to charging the ordinary fee plus this amount without source support.; The proposal omits the stated craft-allocation limit relevant to which tugs/services attract the listed additional-tug surcharge: the craft type and number allocated for a service are decided by the port, and surcharge applies to a tug provided in addition to the maximum allocation. The amount/application therefore depends on this allocation, which the proposal does not preserve.; The proposal applies the same +25% after-standby cancellation modifier as if it were a 25% surcharge, but the source says fees as if the service had been performed are payable, i.e. normal fees enhanced by 25%. This is a 125% total charge, rather than a standalone 25% fee; the proposal does not clearly preserve that full-fee-plus-enhancement basis.
- **pilotage**: The proposal omits the separate Saldanha charge for pilots on board tanker vessels during the vessel’s stay: the source lists PLO duties at 886.20 per hour. This is an additional pilotage service and is not represented by the normal entering/leaving-port tariff.; The proposal omits the stated rule that any vessel movement without the Authority’s consent is subject to full pilotage charges as if the service had been performed. This changes when pilotage charges are payable, even where a pilotage service was not actually performed.
- **berthing_services**: The incremental tariff is stated as “per 100 tons or part thereof,” but the proposal records only a gross-tonnage basis and rate, omitting the 100-ton billing unit. Applying the rate per gross ton instead of per 100 tons (rounded up) would produce a different charge.; The proposal omits the separate charge for berthing staff attending aboard tanker vessels discharging crude or petroleum products (including LPG vessels) at Mossel Bay and Saldanha Bay: 1,267.83 per hour or part thereof. This is an additional berthing-services tariff for the specified service, not represented by the listed general per-service tariff.
