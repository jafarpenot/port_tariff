- pricing_type: 'per_unit' params: {'rate': 117.08}
- warning: value 117.08 not found verbatim on its cited page(s) — PDF formatting may differ from the raw number.
- (material) The mapped rate is not 117.08 per gross ton: the tariff prints “Per 100 tons or part thereof” at 117.08. The proposal omits the 100-ton unit, which changes the amount charged if interpreted as a per-ton rate.
- (material) The proposal marks the charge as per_call, but the source says light dues are raised at the first South African port of call and remain valid until departure from the last South African port of call, subject to the stated territorial and 60-day conditions. It also says a vessel remaining within a specific port for an extended period is charged only once. Per-call multiplicity does not capture this validity/applicability rule and could imply repeat charges at subsequent port calls.
- (material) The proposal omits the stated exemption for foreign naval/war vessels. This exemption affects whether light dues are charged.

- (material) The proposal omits the tariff-wide 15% VAT stated on the source page. Its listed rates/modifiers therefore do not capture the tax applicable to the amount charged.
- (material) The source specifies both the basic fee and the incremental fee per 100 tons or part thereof. The proposal gives only basis=gross_tonnage and does not preserve the 100-ton billing unit or the part-thereof rule; applying the rates directly per gross ton would materially misstate the charge.
- (material) The source says a part of a 24-hour incremental period is applied pro rata. Although the proposal calls the increment a daily_rate, it does not record the pro-rata treatment for partial periods, which can change the assessed amount.
- (material) The proposal omits the source's applicability clauses: port dues are payable for the period from a vessel passing the entrance inward until passing it outward, and also by vessels taking bunkers at the designated anchorage and vessels at offshore moorings or similar facilities. Omitting these conditions can lead to dues not being assessed on covered calls/stays.

- (material) The proposal assigns Mossel Bay a rate for vessels above 50,000 GT by carrying forward the 10,001–50,000 GT base and increment. The source marks the Mossel Bay entries as “n/a” for both 50,001–100,000 GT and above 100,000 GT, so these bands should not be priced as proposed.
- (material) The proposal assigns East London a charge above 100,000 GT using the prior band’s base and rate. The source marks the East London entry above 100,000 GT as “n/a”; this is not a continuation of the 50,001–100,000 GT tariff.

- (material) The proposal assigns the 50% surcharge to every port, but the tariff's ordinary-working-hours definition on page 6 says marine-services surcharges may apply at Mossel Bay and East London, while Richards Bay, Ngqura, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Saldanha operate 24-hour service. It does not support a blanket surcharge applicability for all listed ports; the surcharge's application needs to reflect the relevant ordinary-hours rules by port.
- (minor) The tanker-attendance modifier is included under every port rule even though the tariff limits it specifically to the Ports of Mossel Bay and Saldanha Bay. This special hourly charge does not apply at Richards Bay, Port Elizabeth/Ngqura, Cape Town, or Other Ports.

### Disagreements
- **light_dues**: The mapped rate is not 117.08 per gross ton: the tariff prints “Per 100 tons or part thereof” at 117.08. The proposal omits the 100-ton unit, which changes the amount charged if interpreted as a per-ton rate.; The proposal marks the charge as per_call, but the source says light dues are raised at the first South African port of call and remain valid until departure from the last South African port of call, subject to the stated territorial and 60-day conditions. It also says a vessel remaining within a specific port for an extended period is charged only once. Per-call multiplicity does not capture this validity/applicability rule and could imply repeat charges at subsequent port calls.; The proposal omits the stated exemption for foreign naval/war vessels. This exemption affects whether light dues are charged.
- **port_dues**: The proposal omits the tariff-wide 15% VAT stated on the source page. Its listed rates/modifiers therefore do not capture the tax applicable to the amount charged.; The source specifies both the basic fee and the incremental fee per 100 tons or part thereof. The proposal gives only basis=gross_tonnage and does not preserve the 100-ton billing unit or the part-thereof rule; applying the rates directly per gross ton would materially misstate the charge.; The source says a part of a 24-hour incremental period is applied pro rata. Although the proposal calls the increment a daily_rate, it does not record the pro-rata treatment for partial periods, which can change the assessed amount.; The proposal omits the source's applicability clauses: port dues are payable for the period from a vessel passing the entrance inward until passing it outward, and also by vessels taking bunkers at the designated anchorage and vessels at offshore moorings or similar facilities. Omitting these conditions can lead to dues not being assessed on covered calls/stays.
- **towage**: The proposal assigns Mossel Bay a rate for vessels above 50,000 GT by carrying forward the 10,001–50,000 GT base and increment. The source marks the Mossel Bay entries as “n/a” for both 50,001–100,000 GT and above 100,000 GT, so these bands should not be priced as proposed.; The proposal assigns East London a charge above 100,000 GT using the prior band’s base and rate. The source marks the East London entry above 100,000 GT as “n/a”; this is not a continuation of the 50,001–100,000 GT tariff.
- **pilotage**: The proposal omits the tariff-wide 15% VAT condition. Page 7 states that tariffs are subject to VAT at 15%; therefore the listed pilotage amounts are not the full amount charged where VAT applies.
- **berthing_services**: The proposal assigns the 50% surcharge to every port, but the tariff's ordinary-working-hours definition on page 6 says marine-services surcharges may apply at Mossel Bay and East London, while Richards Bay, Ngqura, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Saldanha operate 24-hour service. It does not support a blanket surcharge applicability for all listed ports; the surcharge's application needs to reflect the relevant ordinary-hours rules by port.
